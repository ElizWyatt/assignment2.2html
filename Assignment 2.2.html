        <p>When it comes to my Real Estate career, my motto and mission is, "My Customer Comes First". Whether I am
            assisting in the sale of your house or helping you find your next dream home, my focus is to take the stress
            out of the transaction and make the process as worry-free as possible. Having studied engineering at Georgia
            Tech, I appreciate the importance of paying attention to details and making all of the pieces come together
            to solve a problem. This type of focus enables me to manage all of the details of a real estate transaction
            starting with the offer all the way through a successful closing. Through my extensive experience as a sales
            professional, I have fine-tuned my negotiating and communication skills. As a result, whether you are buying
            or selling I can help you negotiate the best price the market will support as well as help negotiate any
            additional details of the contract. I enjoy working with both sellers and buyers. It is so gratifying to me
            when I can help a client sell a home quickly at a fair market price. I also especially enjoy helping
            customers find that Florida dream home they are looking for. I look forward to working with you soon.
